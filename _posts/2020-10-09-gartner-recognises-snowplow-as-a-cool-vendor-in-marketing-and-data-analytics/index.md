We are delighted to announce that Gartner has recognised Snowplow as a cool vendor in Marketing and Data Analytics.  

To be defined as a Cool Vendor by Gartner, a company must be considered innovative or transformative for products, services or initiatives.  The criteria by which a vendor is defined as “cool” are:



*   **Innovative**– the vendor has developed technologies/products that enable users to do things they couldn’t do before
*   **Impactful**– the vendor offers technologies/products that have or will have business impact; it’s not just “technology for the sake of technology”
*   **Intriguing** – the vendor has caught Gartner’s interest/curiosity during the past 12 months

According to Gartner’s 2018 Marketing Data and Analytics Survey, more than half (52%) of marketing analytics leaders rank data management activities among the top three tasks that consume their teams’ time. Two years later, the 2020 Marketing Data and Analytics Survey reported that 64% of respondents attributed data management, integration and formatting to be their most time-consuming activities.
